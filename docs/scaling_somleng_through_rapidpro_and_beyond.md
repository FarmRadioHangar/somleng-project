# Scaling Somleng through RapidPro and Beyond

## Preface

This document assumes that you have some basic knowledge about [Somleng](https://github.com/somleng/somleng-project/blob/master/docs/what_is_somleng.md), [Twilio](https://github.com/somleng/somleng-project/blob/master/docs/what_is_twilio.md) and [RapidPro](https://community.rapidpro.io/) and that you have a basic understanding about the [differences between Somleng and Twilio](https://github.com/somleng/somleng-project/blob/master/docs/somleng_twilio_comparison.md).

## Introduction

With the addition of the TwiML compliant channel, RapidPro now supports both Twilio and Somleng out of the box.

In a nutshell, this means that you can connect your RapidPro flow to a Somleng instance and deliver/receive calls through your local operator.
