## Cambodia

### The Early Warning System

Cambodia is a country consistently ranked as one of the most vulnerable to the effects of natural disasters.

In order to deliver timely and potentially lifesaving information to people in disaster prone areas an Early Warning System (EWS) was conceived by the organization [People In Need (PIN)](https://www.clovekvtisni.cz/en/what-we-do/humanitarian-aid-and-development/cambodia) <sup>[1](#footnote-ews-article)</sup>.

[PIN](https://www.clovekvtisni.cz/en/what-we-do/humanitarian-aid-and-development/cambodia) realized that the EWS needs to be accessible to all Cambodians, regardless of literacy and Internet connectivity issues.

They decided to look into solution which uses voice based messaging for alerts and [(IVR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response) for registration. In collaboration with [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/cambodia), they decided to use [RapidPro](http://rapidpro.io/), an open-source platform of applications that delivers rapid and vital real-time information, to manage the registration of users into the system.

With help from the Royal Cambodian Government, the [Telecommunication Regulator of Cambodia (TRC)](https://www.trc.gov.kh) and the [National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM)](http://www.ncdm.gov.kh/) regulated that the Early Warning System must be provided free of charge by the [Mobile Network Operators (MNOs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_network_operator) in Cambodia.

With the pieces of the puzzle coming together the problems that still remained were:

1. How to connect RapidPro to the MNOs for user registration?
2. How to send out automated alerts to people in at risk in the event of an emergency?

## Somalia

In Somalia Returnee households from Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya and vulnerable households in Bay and Bakool received emergency unconditional cash-based transfer assistance package to help them meet their needs during the current drought period. In order to share information about the program and get feedback voice-based messaging is used.
